## Hi, I'm Andrey!

I'm a software developer who loves solving problems.

I'm passionate about software craftsmanship and I like to build things. I enjoy
solving challenging engineering puzzles, working with data and creating products
that makes peoples' lives better. I have the most experience in Ruby, Elixir and
JavaScript (react/vue), but I consider myself to be a software engineer in general,
not constrained by particular language or technology.

I like to build side projects too. Currently I am creating [Hamster Travel](/hamster-travel)
to manage my travel planning and [Igroteka](/igroteka) to manage my gaming backlog.

## Work

I am a senior developer at Shopify core team working on order management. We build
one of the best e-commerce products out there - and I promise to write more about it!

## Hobbies

I dedicate most of my free time to my beautiful family. Other than that, I like to
travel, play videogames and read.

You can find my travels map on my [hamster-travel profile](https://travel.hmstr.rocks/ru/users/191#!/map).
Books I read are on my [goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4208481-andrey-marchenko).
I play single player and story driven videogames on PS5, Xbox Series X and Nintendo Switch
consoles (you can have a sneak peek into how I manage my gaming backlog [here](/igroteka)).
