### Features

_describe..._

- search games by name
- display a page with basic information about a game
- add a game to my backlog and put in one of the following lists: "Wishlist”, “To play”, “Currently playing”, “Played”
- save additional information about a game in my backlog like platform (PC, PS5, etc), priority in the backlog or how much did I enjoy this game
- for each game show critic rating and critic reviews for that game
- for each game show approximately how long would it take to finish it
- show screenshots and videos for every game

### Data sources

So there are three main topics to cover:

- games data
- game reviews
- how long is the game

There are several public API providers with games data, the most popular ones being [Giantbomb](https://www.giantbomb.com) and [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/discover).

HTTP API for the frontend to consume.
